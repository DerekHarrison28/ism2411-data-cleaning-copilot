What Copilot generated:
    Copilot genreated the base code to help clean and sort the data in the base csv file. All of the code that is in the functions is Generated by copilot including, clean_column_names, handle_missing_values, and remove_invalid_rows. I prompted it with the comments listed in the file and directed it to use specific column names in the data set. I also directed the AI to clean specific errors in the data such as double spaces in between words and specifc missing data points in the raw data. 

What you modified:
    I organised the lines of code into excecutable funtions, and debugged that to work with the generated code moved into the functions I created. Some Column names that copilot called on were incorrect for the data I had, seemingly general column names. This was needed to specifically target the lines of code that had broken code.

What you learned:
    I learned that data cleaning in Python means fixing missing values, standardizing column names, and correcting mistakes in data. Copilot is helpful because it can write code fast, but it can make small mistakes. For example, it made a function that did not take any input, which caused an error that I had to fix.
